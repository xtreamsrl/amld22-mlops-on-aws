    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "It is January 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just started your new position: you've joined the Applied Machine Learning team of an Italian utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "You barely had the time to meet your new colleagues, and you already have your first task. Up until now, the company relied on an external service to forecast the power demand of its customers. It is now time to internalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power demand forecasting is a critical task for every utility: power storage is neither cheap nor widely available, so the balance of the grid must be guaranteed at any time. The production must match the demand. In Italy, this is ensured by the free power market, where utilities can trade power production, and by *ad-hoc* actions performed by the Transmission System Operator (TSO).\n",
    "\n",
    "To safeguard the smooth operation of the system, utilities must produce day-ahead hourly forecasts of the power demand of their customers, and they get financial penalties for errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Simplification.</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider daily forecasting of the Italian load, instead of hourly forecast of the demand from the customers of a specific company.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before jumping into day-ahead forecasting, you are required to produce some long-term models. They are baselines to be used in the case of any issue with the short-term predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, your initial problem statement is as follows.\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Problem Statement</b> \n",
    "    \n",
    "Given Italian daily power load data from 2006 to 2019, forecast the daily load in 2020. In general, the model shall be able to produce one-year-ahead forecasts.\n",

    "Fortunately, Matteo and Gabriele, the ML Engineers in your team, developed an automated pipeline to ensure that the dataset is constantly updated. The pipeline takes care of harmonizing the different data formats, and checks for outliers or missing data, so that you can trust the consistency of the processed dataset.\n",
